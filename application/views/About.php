        <p>The vision of the website is to feature a header photo spanning the top of the page which will be directly
            succeeded by a menu bar featuring links to all relevant pages of the website, including a login bar at the far right. The colour scheme will feature light, eye-pleasing tones, and photos will be prevalent throughout all pages as seen fit. </p>
