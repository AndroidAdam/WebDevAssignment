        <h4>Will the price of my membership increase?</h4>
        <p>Our Value Priced Memberships are guaranteed at your joining rate for the duration of the term of the membership you join for. Once the minimum term of the membership is reached, then your membership rate could be subject to change (but be assured the rates will always be value priced).

<br>If you wanted to secure the monthly dues rate that you originally joined at, than you can purchase our Price For Life Plan for a onetime fee of $20.00 at the time of joining.  Price For Life Plan is a guarantee that your monthly dues will never increase as   long as you remain an active member in good standing.</p>

In person at club you will receive a receipt of your application to cancel which you should keep as proof of cancellation. All monies owing must be paid prior to your cancellation being finalized.</p>
